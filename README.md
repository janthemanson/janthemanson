ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @janthemanson

I'm a media and content designer with a good expertise in e-commerce and over 9 years of expierience in this field. Got some basic skills in programming and software administration.
Even though I don't have a degree in media design, I have been able to acquire a much broader range of IT knowledge and skills than trained media designers would have.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, media design, content design, content structures, erp software, python, data structures, data modeling, api programming, (multi model) databases and more. Especially interested in svelte, fastapi, arangodb.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and fastapi framework.
